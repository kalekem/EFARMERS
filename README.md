EFARMERS:
Finding market for agricultural products is a challenge for many Kenyan farmers. Many of them only sell on market days, missing out on the bigger customer base. Sometimes they wonâ€™t even find someone to buy their products at all leading to massive losses. In other cases, middlemen buy their products at very low prices just because of the lack of exposure to the right markets. E-Farmers serves to solve this problem by helping farmers market their produce to people in different locations. It also enables customers/ buyers view what product is available in which location.

The app allows the farmer to create an account in which they include their name, phone number and location. They then upload the products to their account and buyers using the app would be able to view this information and if they find a product that they like they call the farmer and arrange for transaction and transportation. 

It serves to solve an existing problem faced by a large group of people. If successful, it can revolutionize the way farmers interact with buyers, change their lives and improve the economy of the country at large

Farmers can also use the app to rent pieces unused land to other farmers/ sellers to grow crops and therefore it will increase the production base of agricultural products and ensure that unused land is used to grow something valuable. No more wastage of land.
